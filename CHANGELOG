1.1.0 :: kyle :: 2015-05-01
===========================

* Support both of the Scrypt security levels. The interactive level
  is faster but provides a lower level of security; this isn't the
  default and must be explicitly chosen.

* The common crypto, authentication, utility, and TLV packages are all
  at 100% coverage. Future work will attempt to bring store to a similar
  level of testing.

1.0.4 :: kyle :: 2014-01-03
===========================
Fix version display from 1-0-3 to 1.0.3.

1.0.3 :: kyle :: 2014-01-01
===========================
Add support for listing files in an archive.

1.0.2 :: kyle :: 2014-12-31
===========================
This is the first the version that is actually semantically-versioned.
The choice of starting the versioning with a release number of 2 stems
from the fact that there was a first version announced; this was followed
a minor update with some bug fixes and de-typo'ing.
